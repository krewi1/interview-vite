Choose two warmups or even create your own to show us scoping fun and event loop fixing

1. Refactor promise -> async/await `fetchGamesAsync` or Refactor async/await -> promise `fetchBeerPromise`
3. Why the timeouts are out of order? `timeout.ts`
4. Binding issues `binding.ts`

## Write a tree component

- Fellow team member got stuck with implementing a tree component,
  everything seems broken and typescript with React seems overhelming
- Please save him and guide him towards salvation
- He got stuct with imports and some weird bug in properties
- Let's do some pair programing

## Questions

- What would you do differently?
- How you like to style components?
- Would you use state management?
- Would you connect the tree to global state when?
- Any hints on organizing the project?

# Interview React App

## Setup
 
`git clone https://github.com/jurahu/interview-vite.git && cd interview-vite && npm i`

## Warmup

Choose two warmups or even create your own to show us scoping fun and event loop fixing

 1. Refactor promise -> async/await `fetchGamesAsync` or Refactor async/await -> promise `fetchBeerPromise`
 3. Why the timeouts are out of order? `timeout.ts`
 4. Binding issues `binding.ts`
 5. Fun with iterator fail and scoping `iteratorFail.ts`

## Write a tree component

 - Fellow team member got stuck with implementing a tree component,
   everything seems broken and typescript with React seems overhelming
 - Please save him and guide him towards salvation
 - He got stuct with imports and some weird bug in properties
 - Let's do some pair programing

## Questions

 - What would you do differently?
 - How you like to style components?
 - Would you use state management?
 - Would you connect the tree to global state when?
 - Any hints on organizing the project?
